# Positivity, strict and otherwise

TAGS: recursive-types, totality, impredicativity

In a total language, type definitions that refer to themselves must be restricted:
```coq
-- rejected by Coq
Inductive bad := r (c : bad -> nat).
```
```agda
-- rejected by Agda
data Bad : Set where
  r : (Bad → ℕ) → Curry
```

Here, the type `bad` is defined recursively as consisting of a
function that accepts `bad` as an input. Allowing these _negative_
definitions leads to [Curry's paradox](currys-paradox.md), and breaks
totality.

The situation is more complicated if the recursive reference is
underneath two function arrows:
```coq
-- also rejected by Coq
Inductive bad2 := r (c : (bad2 -> nat) -> nat).
```
```agda
-- also rejected by Agda
data Bad2 : Set where
  r : ((Bad2 → ℕ) → ℕ) → Bad2
```

This is not negative recursion: `bad2` is not defined in terms of
functions that accept `bad2` values as an input, but in terms of
functions that may provide `bad2` values to their argument. This is
said to be positive recursion (since all recursive references to `bad2`
occur to the left of an _even_ number of function arrows), but not
*strictly positive* (wherein all recursive references occur to the
left of _zero_ function arrows).

Recursive definitions which are positive yet not strictly positive can
cause issues, as pointed out by Coquand and Paulin[^colog88]. Their
counterexample was translated into modern Coq by Sjöberg[^sjöberg],
and reproduced here:
```coq

(* Phi is a positive, but not strictly positive, operator. *)
Definition Phi (a : Type) := (a -> Prop) -> Prop.

#[bypass_check(positivity = yes)]
Inductive A: Type :=
  introA : Phi A -> A.

(* If we were allowed to form the inductive type A above (unsoundly bypassing
the positivity restriction), then we get an injective constructor

(* Proposition: For any type A, there cannot be an injection
   from Phi(A) to A. *)

(* For any type X, there is an injection from X to (X->Prop),
   which is λx.(λy.x=y) . *)

(* Hence, by composition, we get an injection f from A->Prop to A. *)
Definition f : (A->Prop) -> A

(* We can define *)
Definition P0 : A -> Prop

  (* i.e., P0 x := x codes a set P such that x∉P. *)

Definition x0 := f P0.

(* We have (P0 x0) iff ~(P0 x0) *)
Lemma bad : (P0 x0) <-> ~(P0 x0).

<!-- FIXME: "recursive" vs. "inductive" terminology -->

This counterexample uses three ingredients: non-strictly-positive
definitions, impredicativity (the ability for definitions of terms in
`Prop` to quantify over all of `Prop`) and a universe type (the
ability to refer to `Prop` itself as a type). It appears that all
three are necessary:

  - The Calculus of Inductive Constructions, upon which Coq is based,
    is total, and has an impredicative `Prop` and a universe type for
    `Prop`, but requires all inductive definitions to be strictly
    positive.

  - System F is impredicative, and can encode (or be extended with)
    non-strictly-positive inductive types while remaining total (see
    Berger et al.[^hofmann] for an example), but lacks a universe type.

  - The combination of non-strictly-positive inductive types and
    universe types is an unusual one, but poses no theoretical
    problems in the absence of impredicativity. See for instance the
    constructions of Abel[^abel] or Blanqui[^blanqui].
